# Nashville-Housing-Data

This repository holds an excel file with unclean Nashville housing data, as well as SQL script used to clean the data.  Data cleaning involved: 
-  Standardizing the date format (leaving the day/month/year and removing the time)
-  Populating missing values for the Property Address data
- Separating the property and owner address column into separate columns for Street, City, and State
- Changing the “Y” and “N” to “Yes” and “No” in the “Sold as Vacant” field
- Deleting redundant columns
